# AES-NPP-Core

A very basic console application designed to allow you to launch a command window with the text contained from an AES encrypted file. The AES encrypted file (as of now, at least) must be decrypted using AESCrypt, and as such, requires a copy of AESCrypt.

No, I'm not writing any instructions on how to use it. If you need instructions and can't figure it out from the code, this program likely isn't suited for you anyway. It does what I needed it to do, and as it stands, that's all I have planned for it.

It's written in .NET Core but right now it's going to throw an exception if you try running it on anything but Windows.
It used to use Notepad++ - that was dumb. Now, it's fully self-contained; the name remains the same and "NPP" now means nothing.
